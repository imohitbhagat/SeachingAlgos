Like Binary Search, Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.

Time Complexity : **O(√n)**
Auxiliary Space : **O(1)**


**Important points:**
 
1) Works only sorted arrays.
2) The optimal size of a block to be jumped is (√ n). 
3) This makes the time complexity of Jump Search O(√ n).
4) The time complexity of Jump Search is between Linear Search ( ( O(n) ) and Binary Search ( O (Log n) ).
5) Binary Search is better than Jump Search, but Jump search has an advantage that we traverse back only once (Binary Search may require up to O(Log n) jumps, consider a situation where the element to be searched is the smallest element or just bigger than the smallest). So in a system where binary search is costly, we use Jump Search.
